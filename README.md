## Project Description
Please find the description of the concepts implemented in this project detailed below

1. **Front End - Shopping Cart Application**
  - Angular with bootstrap website template design from http://w3layouts.com/
  - Concepts
    - **Registration control validations:** Template driven forms.
    - **Login control validations:** Reactive forms.
    - **Client-side authorization:** Route Guard.
    	- Example: First level verification to check for the user authentication ensuring a JWT token was created in the local storage.
    - **Server-side authorization:** HttpInterceptor.
    	- Example: Sends JWT web token as a `HttpHeader` check for authorization of each API call.
    - **Services:** Services to make API calls and establish communication between unrelated components.
    	- Example: Searching for products in the `Header` component triggers the search in the `Listproducts` component.
    - **Custom pipes:**
    	- Example: Used for the shortening product description for each product displayed on the home page.
    - **Dynamic routing:** Dynamic routing using URL parameters.
    	- Example: Filter products based on their `Category ID`.
	
  - Performance
  	- **Eager loading:** Modules that do not need authentication.
  		- Example: Browsing products on the home page.
	- **Lazy loading:** Feature module that gets downloaded asynchronously using route parameter detailed below.
		- RouterModule.forRoot | preloadingStrategy parameter: PreloadAllModules.

  - To-do: Part 1
  	- User address capturing feature.
  	- Payment feature.
  	- Update or remove products.
  	- Content for static pages.
	
2. **Backend End - .Net Core 5 Web API**
  - .Net Core 5 Web API with Swagger documentation generated by code.
  - Concepts
    - **Swagger documentation and API testing:**
    	- The API details are generated from the NuGet package `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore`.
    	- The `swagger.json` is generated by code after compilation using information from `XML comments` in code using NuGet package `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations`.
    	- API testing is possible from this user interface.
    - **User Registration:** Passwords are hashed and stored in the database.
    - **Authentication:** Once the user credentials are validated, a JWT token is sent as a response.
    - **Authorization:** Endpoints that need authorization are protected by validating the JWT token using the concept `Authorize Attribute`.

  - To-do: Part 1
	- Logging support.
	- Implement microservices to further modularize each controller's endpoint to provide better maintenance and scalability.
		- Example: `UsersV1Controller` can be created as a new microservice.
	- Use the data access technology `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` to perform CRUD operations in the database. 
	
2. **Database - Microsoft SQL Server 2019**
  - Database details:
	- **Name:** ShoppingCartDB.
	
  - DDL - Tables
    - **T_Users:** Entity that holds all the user credentials.
    - **T_Products:** Entity that holds product details.
    - **T_LU_ProductCategories:** Lookup table that holds category types, based on which products can be filtered.
    - **T_Orders:** Entity that holds a collection of cart items that is associated with a single active order. There can be multiple completed orders but only one active order for a single user.
    - **T_LU_OrdersStatus:** Lookup table that specifies the state of the order.
    	- Example: 
    		- **In Progress:** Indicates an active order.
    		- **Completed:** Indicates orders where the purchase was successful.
    - **T_Cart:** Entity that holds a list of products for a given order.
    
  - To-do: Part 1
  	- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
